# Burger App 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To see this project in action, go to [Demo BurgerApp](https://react-my-burger-ce22a.firebaseapp.com/.

The page will show up a burger page, first of all you need to sign in first by clicking the Authenticate Page, and then enter a fake email and password. After that you can order the burger by clicking 'More' or 'Less' on the ingredients lists, and then click 'ORDER NOW' when finished. It will pop up a modal showing your orders, click continue to proceed. After that you can enter your contact data on the form and click 'ORDER' to continue and it will send your data which might be a bit long like 4 or 5 seconds. After that it will redirect you to the main burger page which means the data has sent and you are done.
